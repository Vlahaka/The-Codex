**Summary:**  
A speculative cosmological framework proposing that the universe arises from distortions in a 2×3 dimensional Phase Field. It separates spatial dimensions (ϕ⁻) from impulse dimensions (ϕ⁺), suggesting that matter, gravity, and structure emerge from the interplay of distortions and anti-distortions across these dimensions. The model attempts to explain cosmic expansion, dark energy, and galaxy rotation without invoking traditional Big Bang or dark matter assumptions.  

**Notes:**  
- The author suggests that gravity is stronger in colder regions due to increased field rigidity — a claim that contradicts observed astrophysical thermodynamics.  
- Despite structural flaws, the framework orbits around the core insight that the universe did not emerge from nothing, but from a pre-existing structured field.  
- Developed in cooperation with an AI (likely ChatGPT or similar), though the ideas originate from the human contributor.
