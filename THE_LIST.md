### 1.  Phase Distortion Model

**Platform:** Reddit (r/LLMPhysics)  
**Summary:**  
A speculative cosmological framework proposing that the universe arises from distortions in a 2×3 dimensional Phase Field. It separates spatial dimensions (ϕ⁻) from impulse dimensions (ϕ⁺), suggesting that matter, gravity, and structure emerge from the interplay of distortions and anti-distortions across these dimensions. The model attempts to explain cosmic expansion, dark energy, and galaxy rotation without invoking traditional Big Bang or dark matter assumptions.  

**Notes:**  
- The author suggests that gravity is stronger in colder regions due to increased field rigidity — a claim that contradicts observed astrophysical thermodynamics.  
- Despite structural flaws, the framework orbits around the core insight that the universe did not emerge from nothing, but from a pre-existing structured field.  
- Developed in cooperation with an AI (likely ChatGPT or similar), though the ideas originate from the human contributor.

### 2.  Hypothesis: Black Holes as Seed Cells for Universes in a Superordinate Medium

**Platform:** Reddit (r/cosmology)  
**Summary:**  
This hypothesis proposes that black holes are not endpoints of matter, but generators of new universes. The author describes a superordinate medium called "black matter" — an ultra-dense, structured fluid that surrounds and gives rise to black holes. Universes form inside these black holes, undergoing a five-zone transformation process from fragmentation to fractal nucleation. Time and gravity are treated as scalable, local phenomena. The model embraces an infinite, cyclic multiverse where new universes are continuously generated from prior structures.  

**Notes:**  
- The idea of **black holes as universe seeds** aligns structurally with emergent cosmology and pre-origin frameworks.  
- The author introduces "black matter" as distinct from dark matter — a more condensed, structured substrate enabling universe formation.  
- The model avoids a singular Big Bang, opting for a **fractal, cyclic process without memory**.  
- Authored independently, revised via ChatGPT, but clearly originating from the human's long-held internal concept.

### 3. The Universe Breathes, Lives, and Thinks

**Platform:** Reddit (r/universe)  
**Summary:**  
This short metaphysical framework proposes that the universe is a living, breathing entity — not a lifeless mechanism. The author describes the universe as capable of expansion and contraction (like breath), complexity (like thought), and possibly perception. There is an underlying assertion that the universe is not singular or static, but part of a recursive, regenerative cycle. While poetic in tone, the framework implies that the universe did not emerge from nothing, but is embedded within a larger, structured process.

**Notes:**  
- Though not formally structured, the post directly **rejects a universe from nothing** and implies continuous motion and internal recursion.  
- Aligns metaphorically with cyclical and living-universe models, suggesting **pre-Big Bang continuity**.  
- The format is minimal and reflective, not technical — but still points to **convergent metaphysical insight**.

### 4. 🧠 Wave Memory Resonance Hypothesis  
**Author**: Nick A*****n  
**Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Source**: [Reddit – TheoriesOfEverything](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoriesOfEverything/s/0YbKQex8nv)  

**Summary**:  
A resonance-based cosmological model proposing that waves—not particles—are the true substrate of the universe. Reality is structured by recursive wave interference patterns that encode memory intrinsically via resonance. The theory introduces the concept of a "Dynamic Zero" — a tensionless equilibrium state from which existence emerges as wave deviations create standing echoes and nested structures. Gravity, electromagnetism, and time are redefined through phase coherence and resonance scaling. Consciousness arises from resonance-based perception and interaction. Black holes are described as resonance-encoding nodes rather than annihilation points. The model unifies cosmology, quantum structure, biology, and cognition through a single wave-based framework.

**Codex Relevance**:  
- Independent human-origin theory developed in cooperation with AI  
- Points toward a pre-Big Bang substrate (Dynamic Zero)  
- Structurally coherent and metaphysically complete  
- Shares resonance with other Codex entries while maintaining unique logic and terminology
