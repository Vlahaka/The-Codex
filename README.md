# The-Codex


This repository collects independently published theoretical models by individuals working outside institutional frameworks.
These thinkers operate without formal collaboration, and often without training â€” using public platforms, personal tools, or AI assistance to explore cosmological, metaphysical, or structural questions.

Each entry is documented as-is: a public link, a brief summary, and no judgment.
Inclusion is based solely on the consistency, originality, and structural nature of the published material.

The Codex does not represent consensus. It does not seek completeness.
It exists to document what is already happening:
individual human minds, separated by time and space, producing theoretical structures outside the academic sphere.
